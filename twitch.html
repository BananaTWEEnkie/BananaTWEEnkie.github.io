					<h1>Tell us why you want to work at Twitch and what you can contribute?</h1>

					When I was first introduced to Twitch, it was on the month of October in the year 2012, during the League of Legends World Championship. I will always remember all the great memories I shared with Twitch. I laughed, I cried, I stayed up late with Twitch's audiences as it grew to great heights. I felt the unapproving glares from my family. Their words resounded within my head, "<i>What are you doing? Stop wasting your time!</i>" But I did not allow this to deter me from pursuing a future with Twitch. I knew in my <i class="fa fa-heart" style="display:inline;color:red"></i> what I wanted. They didn't understand what Twitch has done for me. Twitch introduced me to the world of eSports, and continues to do so to this day. I was pulled from the depths of my darkest emotions and was shown to live life to the fullest. The fans, the bond ranging from the community to the professional players seen on camera... it all amazed me. I made it my mission to contribute to the growth of eSports and offer the upmost support that Twitch deserves.

					Coding quickly became a passion of mine when I discovered it two years ago. My love for puzzle games, such as Professor Layton, led me to be enamored with the difficult challenges and satisfying solutions that coding offered. It spurred me to strive in bettering myself every day, utilizing new strategies and scrapping ideas that didn't work after exhausting all possibilities. As a curious person, I explore all options to the best of my abilities. I reach out to others to assist those who struggle, because I can empathize with their emotions. I strive to go past not just my bounderies, but my capacity. I study vigoriously to not just pass my courses, but to obtain knowledge to achieve my lifelong goals.

				<h1>What makes me awesome?<h2>
				</center>
				<p>
					<li>I love to code.</li>
					<br/>
					<dd>
						I spend most of my time doing projects, doing class projects, tutoring people who need help in coding, and hosting workshops to further educate those who are interested. This way, I can always polish my coding skills.
					</dd>
					<br/>
					<li>I love games and eSports.</li>
					<br/>
					<dd>
						I am an officer for my university's <a href="http://www.cppgamedev.com/">game design & development club</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/CPPESPORTS/">eSports club</a>. I contributed my free time to volunteer as one of the few league of legends coordinators, the leader of my university club on the League of Legends client, and a manager for the Cal Poly Pomona team when they placed as the top 8 of <a href="http://ulol.leagueoflegends.com/campus-series.html" title="North American Collegiate Competition">NACC</a><sup><i class="fa fa-asterisk tooltip"></i></sup> West, essentially placing in the top 20 of North America.
					</dd>
					<br/>
					<li>I love to draw.</li>
					<br/>
					<dd>
						I enjoy exploring my creativity and applying it onto paper. From time to time I get a strong urge to bust out my tablet/pencil and sketch what comes to mind. I exercise my creativity and love to combine it with my technical side. 
					</dd>
				</p>
				<p>
					See what I am up to! I am always up for going to game/technology/eSports related events! If my time and introvert energy permits of course.
