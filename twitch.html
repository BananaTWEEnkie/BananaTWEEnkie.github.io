					<h1>Tell us why you want to work at Twitch and what you can contribute?</h1>

				<p class="indent">
					When I was first introduced to Twitch, it was on the month of October in the year 2012, during the League of Legends World Championship. I will always remember all the great memories I shared with Twitch. I laughed, I cried, I stayed up late with Twitch's audiences as it grew to great heights. I felt the unapproving glares from my family. Their words resounded within my head, "<i>What are you doing? Stop wasting your time!</i>" They didn't understand what Twitch has done for me. But I did not allow this to deter me from pursuing a future with Twitch. I knew in my <i class="fa fa-heart" style="display:inline;color:red"></i> what I wanted. Twitch introduced me to the world of esports, and continues to do so to this day. I was pulled from the depths of my darkest emotions and was shown to live life to the fullest. The fans, the bond ranging from the community to the professional players seen on camera... it all amazed me. I made it my mission to contribute to the growth of esports and offer the utmost support that Twitch deserves.

					Coding quickly became a passion of mine when I discovered it two years ago. My love for puzzle games, such as Professor Layton, led me to be enamored with the difficult challenges and satisfying solutions that coding offered. It spurred me to strive in bettering myself every day, utilizing new strategies and scrapping ideas that didn't work after exhausting all possibilities. As a curious person, I explore all options to the best of my abilities. I reach out to others to assist those who struggle, because I can empathize with their emotions. I strive to go past not just my boundaries, but my capacity. I study vigorously to not just pass my courses, but to obtain knowledge to achieve my lifelong goals.

					<li>I love games and esports.</li>

						I am an officer for my university's <a href="http://www.cppgamedev.com/">game design & development club</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/CPPESPORTS/">esports club</a>. I contributed my free time to volunteer as one of the few league of legends coordinators, the leader of my university club on the League of Legends client, and a manager for the Cal Poly Pomona team when they placed in the top 8 of

						</div> West, essentially placing in the top 20 of North America.
						<p>
							Currently, I am an advocate for Collegiate Esports. My hope is to have the competitive gaming clubs like ours become recognized by universities to help establish helpful scholarship opportunities. My plan to help facilitate this goal includes drafting an academic research paper about Esports and submitting it to publishers for increased public awareness and student interest. As a result, the esports community will be taken more seriously and acknowledgement will increase not only throughout our school, but perhaps all across the country.

					<li>I love to code.</li>
					<br/>
					<dd>
						I spend most of my time doing projects, doing class projects, doing weekly programming challenges, tutoring people who need help in coding, and hosting workshops to further educate those who are interested. This way, I can always polish my coding skills.
					</dd>
					<br/>
					<li>I love to draw.</li>
					<br/>
					<dd>
						I enjoy exploring my creativity and applying it onto paper. From time to time I get a strong urge to bust out my tablet/pencil and sketch what comes to mind. I exercise my creativity and love to combine it with my technical side. 
					</dd>
				</p>
				<p>
					See what I am up to! I am always up for going to game/technology/eSports related events! If my time and introvert energy permits of course.
